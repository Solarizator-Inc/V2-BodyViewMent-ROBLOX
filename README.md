# BodyViewMent [V2]
> [!CAUTION]
> Both versions of BodyViewMent, [V1](https://create.roblox.com/store/asset/89662365987335) and [V2](https://create.roblox.com/store/asset/91510699816696), have been deprecated as *Realism is a better source.* Use that instead, *as I now discourage using this.* There is a [Github](https://github.com/MaximumADHD/Character-Realism) for Character Realism, but it is also on the [Creator Store](https://create.roblox.com/store/asset/8421693529/Character-Realism) if you do not want to download the RBXM file or use Rojo in order to set it up.

# How to get
Go to the [Creator Store](https://create.roblox.com/store/asset/91510699816696) (RECOMMENDED) or download the [ZIP file](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/19275286/BodyViewMent.V2.zip).
# How to setup
> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you bought the model with Creator Store, go into Roblox Studio, go to the experience you want to set this up at, go to the Toolbox, press Inventory (second button), and [V2] BodyViewMent must be the very first thing. Drag it into the experience, or click the [V2 BodyViewMent](https://create.roblox.com/store/asset/91510699816696). There should be a confirmation screen or not. If there is, click OK. There should be a folder named: ***Ungroup and put scripts in designated services.*** Open the folder, and there should be 2 *local* scripts, ***StarterGUI***, and ***StarterPlayer > StarterCharacterScripts***. Place them in their said positions.

> If you bought the model as a ZIP file, go to your Downloads, unzip the file, and drag the RBXM to the place you want to add it to. There should be a confirmation screen or not. If there is, click OK. There should be a folder named: ***Ungroup and put scripts in designated services.*** Open the folder, and there should be 2 *local* scripts, ***StarterGUI***, and ***StarterPlayer > StarterCharacterScripts***. Place them in their said positions.


If done, have fun with it!

Remember, this is now ***deprecated*** overall, and again, I discourage using this unless you want no footsteps or a not-actual FP-type experience or something like that.
